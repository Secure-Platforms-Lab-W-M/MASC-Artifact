<h1>Fuel Types</h1>
<p>The app distinguishes between different fuel types for the fuel price report, e.g. ordinary
petrol or petrol with 10% ethanol (E10).</p>
<p>In addition fuel types are categorized, e.g. petrol, diesel or gas. If you drive a hybrid
car (e.g. petrol and gas), the fuel consumption is calculated for each category and not for the
entire car.</p>
