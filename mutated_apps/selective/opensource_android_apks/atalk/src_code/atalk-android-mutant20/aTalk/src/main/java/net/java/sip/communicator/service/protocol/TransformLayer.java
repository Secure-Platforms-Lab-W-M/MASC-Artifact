 * a lot like a <tt>MessageListener</tt> with the major difference being that all the methods are
 * defined with a return value. The events we return would contain all message details after their
 * transformation from by the layer implementation. All methods return <tt>null</tt> in case the
 * <tt>TransformLayer</tt> implementation determines that the message event should not be determined

 * Important Notice: As of May 5 2009, this operation set is still a work in progress and may change

 * require frequent updates to keep compatibility.
