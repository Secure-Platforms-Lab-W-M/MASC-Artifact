/**
 * Generates and properly cleans up temporary files. Similar to
 * {@link File#createTempFile(java.lang.String, java.lang.String)}, this class provides a static method to create
 * temporary files. The temporary files will be created in a special directory to be cleaned up the next time this class
 * is loaded by the JVM. This functionality is required because Win32 platforms will not allow the JVM to delete files
 * that are open. This causes problems with items such as JARs that get opened by a URLClassLoader and can therefore not
 * be deleted by the JVM (including deleteOnExit).
 *
 * The caller should not need to create an instance of this class, although it is possible. Simply use the static
 * methods to perform the required operations. Note that all files created by this class should be considered as deleted
 * at JVM exit (although the actual deletion may be delayed). If persistent temporary files are required, use
 * {@link java.io.File} instead.
 *
 * Refer to Sun bugs 4171239 and 4950148 for more details.
