/**
 * The <tt>ExtendedContactSourceService</tt> as its name states it, extends the
 * <tt>ContactSourceService</tt> in order to provide the possibility to query
 * a contact source by specifying a given <tt>Pattern</tt>. This interface is
 * meant to be implemented by contact sources, where it is possible to match
 * source results directly through a given <tt>Pattern</tt>, i.e. by using:<br>
 * <code>Matcher matcher = pattern.matcher(myString);
 *       if(matcher.find())
 *          ....
 * </code>
 * The advantages of passing a <tt>Pattern</tt> over a <tt>String</tt> are that
 * a <tt>Pattern</tt> can use a predefined regular expression and
 * can define certain properties like Pattern.CASE_INSENSITIVE,
 * Pattern.UNICODE_CASE, etc., which could be important for the search.
