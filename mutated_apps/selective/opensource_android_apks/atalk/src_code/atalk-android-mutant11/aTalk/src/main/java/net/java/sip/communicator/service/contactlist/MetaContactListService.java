/**
 * The <tt>MetaContactListService</tt> handles the global project contact
 * list including contacts from all implemented protocols.
 *
 * An implementation of the <tt>MetaContactListService</tt> would take care
 * of synchronizing the local copy of the contact list with the  versions stored
 * on the various server protocols.
 *
 * All modules that would for some reason like to query or modify the contact
 * list should use this service rather than accessing protocol providers
 * directly.
 *
 * The point of <tt>MetaContact</tt>s is being able to merge different
 * protocol specific contacts so that they represent a single person or identity.
 * Every protocol specific <tt>Contact</tt> would therefore automatically
 * be assigned to a corresponding <tt>MetaContact</tt>. A single
 * MetaContact may containing multiple contacts (e.g. a single person often
 * has accounts in different protocols) while a single protocol specific
 * Contact may only be assigned to a exactly one MetaContact.
 *
 * Once created a MetaContact may be updated to contain multiple protocol
 * specific contacts. These protocol specific contacts may also be removed
 * away from a MetaContact. Whenever a MetaContact remains empty (i.e. all of
 * its protocol specific contacts are removed) it is automatically deleted.
 *
 * Note that for most of the methods defined by this interface, it is likely
 * that implementations require one or more network operations to complete
 * before returning. It is therefore strongly advised not to call these methods
 * in event dispatching threads (watch out UI implementors ;) ) as this may lead
 * to unpleasant user experience.
 *
 * The MetaContactListService also defines a property named:<br>
 * <tt>net.java.sip.communicator.service.contactlist.PROVIDER_MASK</tt><br>
 * When this property is set, implementations of the MetaContactListService
 * would only interact with protocol providers that same property set to the
 * same value. This feature is mostly used during unit testing so that testing
 * bundles could make sure that a tested meta contact list implementation would
 * only load their mocking protocol provider implementations during the test
 * run.
