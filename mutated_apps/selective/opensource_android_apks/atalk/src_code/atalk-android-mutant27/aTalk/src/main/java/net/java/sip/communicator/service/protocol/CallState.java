/**
 * The CallState class reflects the current state of a call. Compared to the state of a single call
 * peer, a call itself has a more limited amount of sets which follow the following cycle:
 *
 * CALL_INITIALIZATION -> CALL_IN_PROGRESS -> CALL_ENDED
 *
 * When you start calling someone or receive a call alert, the call that is automatically created is
 * in the CALL_INITIALIZATION_PHASE. As soon as one of the peers passes into a CONNECTED call peer
 * state, the call would enter the CALL_IN_PROGRESS state. When the last call peer enters a DISCONNECTED
 * state the call itself would go into the CALL_ENDED state and will be ready for garbage collection.
