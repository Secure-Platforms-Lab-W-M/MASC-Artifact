 * This class is used to represent both incoming and outgoing AuthorizationRequests

 * An outgoing Authorization Request is to be created by the user interface when an authorization
 * error/challenge has been received by the underlying protocol. The user interface or any other
 * bundle responsible of handling such requests is to implement the AuthorizationHandler interface
 * and register itself as an authorization handler of a protocol provider. Whenever a request needs
 * to be sent the protocol provider would ask the the AuthorizationHandler to create one through the
 * createAuthorizationRequest() method.
 * <p>
 * Incoming Authorization requests are delivered to the ProtocolProviderService implementation
 * through the AuthorizationHandler.processAuthorizationRequest() method.
