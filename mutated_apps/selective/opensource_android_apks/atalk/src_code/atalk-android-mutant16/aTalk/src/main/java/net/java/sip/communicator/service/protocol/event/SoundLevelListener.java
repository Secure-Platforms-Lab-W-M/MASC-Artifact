 * conference focus and has no <tt>ConferenceMember</tt>s we would be notified of any change in the

 * level would be the aggregated level of all <tt>ConferenceMember</tt>s levels including the one

 * conference focus, but is NOT participating in the conference as a <tt>ConferenceMember</tt>
 * (server) the level would be the aggregated level of all <tt>ConferenceMember</tt>s.
