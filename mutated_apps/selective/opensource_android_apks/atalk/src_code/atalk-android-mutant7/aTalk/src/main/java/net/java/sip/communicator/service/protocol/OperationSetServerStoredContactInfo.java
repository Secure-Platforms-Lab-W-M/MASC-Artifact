 * <p>
 * Various types of details have been defined in the ServerStoredDetails class and can be used with
 * the get methods of this interface. Implementors may also define their own details by extending or

 * Note that this is a read only Operation Set, as it only provides access to information stored by
 * Contacts themselves, and not notes that you have been adding for them..
 * <p>
 * The OperationSetServerStoredContactInfo only concerns Contact-s other than us. For accessing and
 * modifying the information of the user that we are logged in with, we need to use the
 * OperationSetServerStoredAccountInfo
