- Execute OMEMO Regeneration in background thread to avoid ANR.
- Improve Omemo regeneration process to include fixes for mismatched fingerprints, and correct new deviceId init process error
- An instance of PubSubManager must include userJid in parameter passing PubSubManager.getInstanceFor(connection, userJid);
  must also peform leafNode.deleteAllItems() before pubsubManager.deleteNode(nodeId) in
  * SQLiteOmemoStore#purgeUserOmemoData(), #purgeInactiveUserDevices()
  * see https://github.com/processone/ejabberd/issues/3418
- FileTransferConversation#updateProgress()-calculating a moving average for the speed so we don't get jumpy calculations for time etc.
- Update aTalk online link address
- Minor clean up in translation errors parameters {0} and {1}.

    - must init with convertView.setTag(group); otherwise clicked object may not properly defined
    - Must check for (convertView.getTag() instanceof GroupViewHolder) before using the view
    - Must perform groupViewHolder.groupName.setTag(group) for reused and new View
  # metaContactMoved(): Must add destination zero-child group to groups before proceeds.
    if (!groups.contains(newParent)) {

  # Change ROOT_PROTO_GROUP_UID = "Contacts"; Better defined as ContactListRoot
    - MclStorageManager#processGroupContact: add patch to upgrade DB e.g. "ContactListRoot" to "Contacts" etc
     (To be removed in future release)
  # Block any rootGroup i.e. "Contacts" creation in DB metaContactGroup Table
    - Do not allow removal of root group i.e. "Contacts" or VOLATILE_GROUP or non-empty group
  # MetaContactListServiceImpl#resolveProtoPath() update to take care rootGroup

Upload Date:	06/15/2020
Version:		2.3.0 (1130)

- Remove 'Miss Call Notification' option from android notification channel; miss call is controlled via 'Call Notification'
- Add popup notification option for NotificationManager.CALL_SECURITY_ERROR event independent of SECURITY_MESSAGE
  * AndroidPopup: subCategorized mSmallIcon for WARNING_MESSAGE_TYPE, MISSED_CALL_MESSAGE_TYPE and Others e.g. SECURITY_MESSAGE
  * PopupMessageNotificationHandlerImpl: int messageType
- Do not fire missed call notifications if user dismissed the call:
  CallPeerJabberImpl#hangup with reason code set to CallPeerChangeEvent.NORMAL_CALL_CLEARING

- Show heads-up notification for an incoming message only if aTalk is in background.

- Move NotificationHelper() init to aTalkApp onCreate, so to get ready earlier to avoid RemoteServiceException:
  Bad notification for startForeground: RuntimeException: invalid channel for service notification:
  Notification(channel=default pri=0 contentView=null vibrate=null sound=null defaults=0x0 flags=0x60 color=0x00000000 vis=PRIVATE semFlags=0x0 semPriority=0 semMissedCount=0)

- Fix call problem with pidgin v2.13.0 having improper implementation sending 4 instances <jingle xmlns='urn:xmpp:jingle:1' action='session-accept'..>
  * CallPeerJabberImpl#processSessionAccept(): accept only first one and ignore all others; otherwise creates havoc in aTalk i.e.:
  * a. Accidentally stopZrtp() because of new audio stream (new accept), and this will clear all zrtp setup e.g. zrtpEngine == null (NPE)
  * b. VideoActivity#doFinishActivity() does not hangup call properly and the send stream remains active even after call end
  * c. Android system volume get stuck in call setOutputVolumeControl(audioStream, call) settings

- Implement XEP-0353: Jingle Message Initiation: https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0353.htm
  Block and skip handling of any incoming delayed Jingle Messages
- Use common Jingle session id for Jingle <propose/>, session-initiate, and media Call etc for easy handling of call notifications and actions
- Add new CallState#CALL_AUTO_ANSWER to handle call via Jingle Message Initiation.
- Add PopupMessage#EvenType - the type of the event that the popup message for for better handling of the various popup messages.
- Add new message type to SystrayService i.e. MISSED_CALL_MESSAGE_TYPE, JINGLE_INCOMING_CALL and JINGLE_INCOMING_CALL
- Add CallState.CALL_AUTO_ANSWER action in CallListener class to handle Jingle Message Accept and future auto-answer support.
- Change VideoCallActivity property to allow launching when device is in standby

- Fix call compatibility with conversations:
  * Conversation use Jingle Message Initiation for call setup - implement XEP-0353.
  * Add missing 'setup' attribute for fingerprint extension in jingle session-initiate: XEP-0320: Use of DTLS-SRTP in Jingle Sessions
    <fingerprint xmlns='urn:xmpp:jingle:apps:dtls:0' hash='sha-256' setup='actpass'/>
  * Conversations only accept setup.ACTPASS when aTalk is the initiator; Aborted when use setup.PASSIVE
  * Jingle session-initiate sid must be the same as the JingleMessage id, otherwise conversations will immediately terminate the call.
    Copy the JingleMessage id value to CallJabberImpl for use when creating session-initiate
  * Copy GroupExtension from session-initiate to session-accept - required by conversations
    Conversations v2.8.5 expects transport-info trailing session-accept, otherwise gives warning:
    W/conversations: hawk@atalk.sytes.net: no identification tags found in initial offer. we won't be able to calculate mLineIndices
    hawk@atalk.sytes.net: received unhandled jingle action session-info
  * conversations check for attributes ufrag and pwd in <transport/>; check unfrag (null) for space => error
    aTalk must include the same values as specified in session-accept transport-info
    <transport xmlns='urn:xmpp:jingle:transports:ice-udp:1' ufrag='aKw6' pwd='lMi0g0i9hPGJHPeb1TXlkZ9U'/>
  * Rejected by conversation with whitespace in value for <parameter name='imageattr' value='send * recv *'/>
    Negotiation of Generic Image Attributes in the Session Description Protocol (SDP); https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6236
    3.2.  Considerations
    3.2.1.  No imageattr in First Offer
    When the initial offer does not contain the 'imageattr' attribute, the rules in Section 3.1.1.2 require the attribute to be absent in the answer.
    Make aTalk compliance i.e. excluded 'imageattr' if none in the initial offer
  * Caller aTalk rejected: conversations failed with bouncyCastle certificate verification stage - illegal parameter:
    Certificate is signed with SignatureAlgorithm.ecdsa not supported by aTalk
    TlsServerImpl.getCertificateRequest to include ClientCertificateType.ecdsa_sign i.e:
    short[] certificateTypes = new short[]{ ClientCertificateType.rsa_sign, ClientCertificateType.dss_sign, ClientCertificateType.ecdsa_sign};
  * aTalk Video call with conversations cause conversations to crash for h264 codec:
    eu.siacs.conversations W/System.err: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: h264 is not a constant in org.webrtc.VideoCodecType
     When remove H264 from codec offer, aTalk is then able to send/received VP8 video without problem;
     However conversations still has problem decode and display VP8 video.
     Reason: aTalk hardware codedc supported packetization-mode does not really match Conversations (no common codec): need more investigation
     a. send from aalk:
        <payload-type id='105' name='h264' clockrate='90000'>
          <parameter name='profile-level-id' value='42E01f'/>

        </payload-type>
  * OperationSetAutoAnswerJabberImpl: Auto-accept call if call accept via Jingle Message <accept/>

- jisti 2.11.5624/5611 compatibility (video call only work on 5611):
  * jitsi does not respect the setting of <rtcp-mux/> in transport-info, continues to send non rtcp-mux transport info
    aTalk will realign itself to jitsi non rtcp-mux after received first call from jitsi
  * DTLS encryption failed with "cannot export keying material without "extended_master_secret" when aTalk is a server
    Make aTalk backward compatible with jitsi

- Support call via JingleMessage protocol or legacy if peer does not support XEP-0353: Jingle Message Initiation
- Default Opus Codec with useinbandfec=1 and usedtx=0 in advertised transport-info
  Not in rfc7587 specification: opusFormatParams.put("minptime", "10"), so not advertised

- Ensure transport-info of session-accept must have the two attributes i.e. ufrag and pwd specified
  * IceUdpTransportManager#createTransportPacketExtension must set both the attribute values
  * IceUdpTransportManager#wrapupConnectivityEstablishment must not strip the two attributes if transport-info contains child elements

- aTalk cannot handle Jingle transport-info properly when sent separately from session-initialize; session-accept with trailing transport-info
  * Break processJingle() handler into Synchronized (callPeer == null) and Non-Synchronized (callPeer != null)
  * Conversations sends trailing audio/video transport one after another for session-initiate and session-accept.
    Merge session-initiate with trailing transport-info's before being processed by OperationSetBasicTelephonyJabberImpl#processJingle();
    otherwise need to synchronously execute OperationSetBasicTelephonyJabberImpl#processJingle() to completion before process trailing transport-info
  * Must not start generating/processing local transport candidates establishment, before remote transport-info are processed
    - causing problem hold local transport until remote has completed.
  * For session-accept, must consolidated both transport-info's i.e. audio & video before process;
    Otherwise Ice4j#Agent#pruneNonMatchedStreams() prune video component when process the audio transport-info => creating problem.

- Always enable <rtcp-mux/> mode for all calls.
- NotificationServiceImpl#checkDefaultAgainstLoadedNotification: allow update of PopupMessageAction with new setting (no default)
- Enhance NotificationService to support sub-category message Type for Notification event

- Fix RtpDescriptionExtension implementation errors:
  * RtcpmuxExtension is childElement of RtpDescriptionExtension and not IceUdpTransportExtension.
    XEP-0167: Jingle RTP Sessions 1.2.0 (2020-04-22) https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0167.html
    <rtcp-mux/> specifies the ability to multiplex RTP Data and Control Packets on a single port as described in RFC 5761 [13].
  * Multiplexing RTP Data and Control Packets on a Single Port (April 2010), also propose to be included in transport
    https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5761 (5.1.3. Interactions with ICE)
  * Fix incorrect ExtensionProvider specified for <description/>:<rtcp-mux/>
    ProviderManager.addExtensionProvider( RtcpmuxExtension.ELEMENT, RtpDescriptionExtension.NAMESPACE,
        new DefaultExtensionElementProvider<>(RtcpmuxExtension.class));
  * CallPeerMediaHandlerJabberImpl#processOffer() must check for rtcpmux in RtpDescriptionExtension i.e.
        boolean rtcpmux = false;
        if (!description.getChildExtensionsOfType(RtcpmuxExtension.class).isEmpty() ||
            !transport.getChildExtensionsOfType(RtcpmuxExtension.class).isEmpty()) {
            rtcpmux = true;
            getTransportManager().setRtcpmux(true);
        }
  * Add chileElement RtcpmuxExtension support in RtpDescriptionExtension
  * Add parameter RtcpMux in JingleUtils#createDescription() for <rtcp-mux/> inclusion

- Cleanup DtlsFingerprintExtension class removing obsoleted 'required' to confirm with
  XEP-0320: Use of DTLS-SRTP in Jingle Sessions 0.3.1 (2015-10-15).

- Android 10: incoming (audio or video) calls fail to wake android device in standby for ring tone alert.
  Need to implement full-screen intent to start an activity from the background (standby)

- srtp classes improvements
  * DtlsPacketTransformer#initializeSRTPTransformer: use notifyHandshakeComplete() callback to init
  * Report any handShaking alert if any via srtpListener.securityMessageReceived()
  * Ensure the actual srtp security status is used for VideoActivity() encryption for display
  * TlsServierImpl and TslCleintImple now use getSupportedCipherSuites() in bctls DefaultTls_xxx

- OTR not interoperable with pidgin
  * XEP-0201: Best Practices for Message Threads; recommended only but not implemented by pidgin
  * OperationSetBasicInstantMessagingJabberImpl#getThreadIDForAddress(); create one if none found

- NotificationHelper: Set all android notification channels' alert to have silent tone, as aTalk have its own event handler
- Default Opus JNIEncoder#useDtx to false; MediaUtils=>opusFormatParams.put("useinbandfec", "1");
- FFR: Prevent ChatRoomCreateDialog crash on newly installed aTalk where there is no local or server chatRoom.
