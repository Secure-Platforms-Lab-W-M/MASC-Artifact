    <title>Plain Password File <emphasis>(Deprecated)</emphasis></title>
    <para><emphasis>This provider is deprecated and will be removed in a future release. The <link linkend="Java-Broker-Security-Plain-Provider">Plain</link> provider should be used
            instead.</emphasis></para>
    <para> The PlainPasswordFile Provider uses local file to store and manage user credentials. When
        creating an authentication provider the path to the file needs to be specified. If specified
        file does not exist an empty file is created automatically on Authentication Provider
        creation. On Provider deletion the password file is deleted as well.</para>
    <para>For this provider user credentials can be added, removed or changed using
        Management.</para>

        <title>Plain Password File Format</title>

            password pairs separated by colon character. This file must not be modified externally
            whilst the Broker is running.</para>
