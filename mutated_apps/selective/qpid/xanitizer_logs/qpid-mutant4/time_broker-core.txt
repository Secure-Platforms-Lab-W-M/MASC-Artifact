      While a call graph is being constructed, it can occur that a method is called on an object (receiver) for which the heap analysis did not determine a value. In this case, the call graph normally does not contain a called method for this location.
      But since the heap model cannot normally be assumed to be complete in the simulation, Xanitizer allows to extend the call graph heuristically.
      The default strategy (a) (IF_EMPTY) is to generate synthetically heap elements for all concrete workspace subtypes of the declared type in the call location, but only if the set of heap model elements the respective pointer points to is empty.
       Variants are:
      (b) (NEVER) to never extend the call graph heuristically,
      (c) (ALWAYS) to always extend it (i.e., also when the described set of heap model elements is not empty), and
      (d) (IF_EMPTY_EXTENDING_ONLY_WITH_WORKSPACE_METHODS) to only extend the call graph if the set is empty, but only with methods that are declared in the workspace.

The latter alternative reduces the number of false alarms, but if instances are created by reflection rather than by direct constructor invocation in the application, the heuristics will not use the respective types for extending the callgraph.

      There are several strategies how to handle tainted values in the Xanitizer heap simulation. In a comprehensive approach once some heap element has been tainted, this taint will never disappear again. This is because one heap element in the Xanitizer model represents many heap elements in reality, and even when the taint would vanish in one heap element in reality, it might exist further on in others. On the other hand this could lead in some situations to false alarms; 
      Thus, this flag can be set to 'true' in order to remove the taint from heap element when it is detected that a non-tainted datum is overriding it. This approach reduces the number of potential false alarms, but possibly also increases the number of missed true problems.
      The default is 'false', in order to reduce the danger of overlooking true positives. Switch to 'true' if you have many false positive findings in your result which are caused by tainted heap facts, that are not tainted anymore in reality.

      During data flow analysis, when a tainted datum travels in the system, Xanitizer checks at taint sink locations whether the datum matches the argument specified at the taint sink.  If it does, a taint sink has been reached by the taint flow.
      However sometimes the datum itself is not tainted but the represented data object internally aggregates other data values and objects which might be tainted. They are located on the simulated heap and it must be checked whether there are tainted heap elements that are potentially recursively aggregated in the main object. The parameter number specifies how many hierarchical steps through the heap are checked by Xanitizer in this scenario. A value of 0 means that no heap content is checked. Large values mean that search time for matches increases.
      The default value is 2.

      When a setter is called on an object with a tainted argument, normally its byte code is processed in order to see where the taint flows. If there is no byte code for the method, or the method is a system method, the normal semantics is to taint the whole receiver. This can lead to false alarms, since if one setter writes a tainted datum, all non-void methods return a tainted datum, not just the getter corresponding to the setter, deliver tainted return values. This might lead to many false alarms.
      If this flag is 'true', Xanitizer uses a special semantics for getter and setter methods for which the byte code is not analyzed: Specialized taint is generated for such a setter, that can only be read by the corresponding getter. This can reduce the number of false alarms, but in the case that the tainted content written by a setter is being read from the object not by the corresponding getter but in some other way, for example by the toString() method, this will be missed.

      Each end of a data flow can be declared to be a taint sink for a taint flow problem (by using the taint sink kind with name "End of Data Flow").

This is the number of invoked methods the path is passing either backward or forward when starting from the taint source.

    Resource patterns further tailor the set of workspace resource files which is basically determined by the configured search paths. 
    Resource files are registered in the Xanitizer workspace if 
      (a) the file is located directly in a search path of kind XML_DIR or EXTRA_RESOURCES_DIR and matches these patterns
      (b) or some framework simulation automatically picks up a resource file anywhere from the file system, and it matches these patterns.
    CAUTION: Be careful with the exclusion of jsp, ftl files and certain xml files as they are required by framework simulation due to case b.
    *.java, *.class are usually always excluded as they are not treated as resources but separately as Java package code content.
