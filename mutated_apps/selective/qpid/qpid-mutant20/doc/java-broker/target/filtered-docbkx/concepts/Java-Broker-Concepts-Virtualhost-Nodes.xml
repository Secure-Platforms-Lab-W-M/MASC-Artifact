  <title>Virtualhost Nodes</title>
  <para>A <emphasis>virtualhost node</emphasis> is a container for the virtualhost. It has exactly
    one virtualhost.</para>
  <para>A <emphasis>virtualhost node</emphasis> is backed by storage. This storage is used to record
    the durable entities that exist beneath the virtualhost node (the virtualhost, queues, exchanges
    etc).</para>
  <para>When HA is in use, it is the virtualhost nodes of many Brokers that come together to form
    the group. The virtualhost nodes together elect a master. When the high availability feature is
    in use, the virtualhost node has <link linkend="Java-Broker-Concepts-RemoteReplicationNodes">remote replications nodes</link>. There is a remote replication node corresponding to each
    remote virtualhost node that form part of the group.</para>
  <para>
    <emphasis>Virtualhost node</emphasis> also provides an initial configuration for its <emphasis>virtualhost</emphasis>.
    How to specify initial configuration for <emphasis>virtual host</emphasis> is described at
    <xref linkend="Java-Broker-Virtual-Host-Initial-Configuration"/>.
