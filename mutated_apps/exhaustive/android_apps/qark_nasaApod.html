<h2>VULNERABILITY Manifest is manually set to debug</h2>
The android:debuggable flag is manually set to true in the AndroidManifest.xml. This will cause your application to be debuggable in production builds and can result in data leakage and other security issues. It is not necessary to set the android:debuggable flag in the manifest, it will be set appropriately automatically by the tools. More info: http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/application-element.html#debug <br/><br/>

<h2>WARNING Insecure functions found</h2>
The Content provider API provides a method call. The framework does no permission checking on this entry into the content provider besides the basic ability for the application to get access to the provider at all. Any implementation of this method must do its own permission checks on incoming calls to make sure they are allowed. Failure to do so will allow unauthorized components to interact with the content provider.

<h2>WARNING Insecure functions found</h2>
The Content provider API provides a method call. The framework does no permission checking on this entry into the content provider besides the basic ability for the application to get access to the provider at all. Any implementation of this method must do its own permission checks on incoming calls to make sure they are allowed. Failure to do so will allow unauthorized components to interact with the content provider.

<h2>WARNING Ordered broadcast sent with receiverPermission with minimum SDK under 21</h2>
A broadcast, sendOrderedBroadcast which specifies the receiverPermission, but may still be vulnerable to interception, due to the permission squatting vulnerability in API levels before 21. This means any application, installed prior to the expected receiver(s) on the device can potentially receive this broadcast. You should investigate this for potential data leakage. <br/><br/>

<h2>WARNING Ordered broadcast sent with receiverPermission with minimum SDK under 21</h2>
A broadcast, sendOrderedBroadcast which specifies the receiverPermission, but may still be vulnerable to interception, due to the permission squatting vulnerability in API levels before 21. This means any application, installed prior to the expected receiver(s) on the device can potentially receive this broadcast. You should investigate this for potential data leakage. <br/><br/>

<h2>WARNING Insecure functions found</h2>
The Content provider API provides a method call. The framework does no permission checking on this entry into the content provider besides the basic ability for the application to get access to the provider at all. Any implementation of this method must do its own permission checks on incoming calls to make sure they are allowed. Failure to do so will allow unauthorized components to interact with the content provider.

<h2>WARNING Ordered broadcast sent with receiverPermission with minimum SDK under 21</h2>
A broadcast, sendOrderedBroadcast which specifies the receiverPermission, but may still be vulnerable to interception, due to the permission squatting vulnerability in API levels before 21. This means any application, installed prior to the expected receiver(s) on the device can potentially receive this broadcast. You should investigate this for potential data leakage. <br/><br/>

<h2>WARNING Insecure functions found</h2>
The Content provider API provides a method call. The framework does no permission checking on this entry into the content provider besides the basic ability for the application to get access to the provider at all. Any implementation of this method must do its own permission checks on incoming calls to make sure they are allowed. Failure to do so will allow unauthorized components to interact with the content provider.

<h2>WARNING Insecure functions found</h2>
The Content provider API provides a method call. The framework does no permission checking on this entry into the content provider besides the basic ability for the application to get access to the provider at all. Any implementation of this method must do its own permission checks on incoming calls to make sure they are allowed. Failure to do so will allow unauthorized components to interact with the content provider.

<h2>WARNING Insecure functions found</h2>
The Content provider API provides a method call. The framework does no permission checking on this entry into the content provider besides the basic ability for the application to get access to the provider at all. Any implementation of this method must do its own permission checks on incoming calls to make sure they are allowed. Failure to do so will allow unauthorized components to interact with the content provider.

<h2>WARNING Insecure functions found</h2>
The Content provider API provides a method call. The framework does no permission checking on this entry into the content provider besides the basic ability for the application to get access to the provider at all. Any implementation of this method must do its own permission checks on incoming calls to make sure they are allowed. Failure to do so will allow unauthorized components to interact with the content provider.

<h2>WARNING Insecure functions found</h2>
The Content provider API provides a method call. The framework does no permission checking on this entry into the content provider besides the basic ability for the application to get access to the provider at all. Any implementation of this method must do its own permission checks on incoming calls to make sure they are allowed. Failure to do so will allow unauthorized components to interact with the content provider.
