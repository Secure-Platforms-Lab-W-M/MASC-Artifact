[2020-11-23 10:17:38] [build] [2020-11-23 10:17:38] [autobuild]    Explanation for issues of type "ExpiredTargetSdkVersion":
[2020-11-23 10:17:38] [build] [2020-11-23 10:17:38] [autobuild]    As of the second half of 2018, Google Play requires that new apps and app
[2020-11-23 10:17:38] [build] [2020-11-23 10:17:38] [autobuild]    updates target API level 26 or higher.
[2020-11-23 10:17:38] [build] [2020-11-23 10:17:38] [autobuild]    Configuring your app to target a recent API level ensures that users

[2020-11-23 10:17:38] [build] [2020-11-23 10:17:38] [autobuild]    allowing your app to run on older Android versions (down to the
[2020-11-23 10:17:38] [build] [2020-11-23 10:17:38] [autobuild]    minSdkVersion).
[2020-11-23 10:17:38] [build] [2020-11-23 10:17:38] [autobuild]    To update your targetSdkVersion, follow the steps from "Meeting Google Play
